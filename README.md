# photo-survey

Photo Survey is a configurable JavaScript application designed to crowdsource property damage assessments, inventory blighted properties, target reappraisal efforts, and identify structures that could pose safety concerns.

This application includes data management tools designed to process street-level photos and publish pre-authored survey questions.

* Try the [Photo Survey (Local Government) application](http://links.esri.com/localgovernment/tryit/PhotoSurvey/)

## Features

* Conduct focused property surveys (for example: identify blight, damaged structures, or construction activity.)
* Leverage location-enabled photos produced by commercially available cameras and simplify data processing so street-level photo collections can be gathered on a regular basis


## Requirements

**Start now using Esri-supplied sample services and maps**

You can start using the application now by setting it up on a web server running Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) and using sample services supplied by Esri.
You'll need to convert to an application in IIS and use the ASP .NET 4.0 or 4.5. application pool.

**Start now using your own services and maps**
